This is a budgeting app I am currently working on! Gotta pay those bills.

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to enter their current balance, along with any bills they need to calculate and then,
the user would be able to see a subtracted total showing how much money they will have left over after "paying" their bills.

I constantly have to crunch my bills every month and I always do it on paper, so I sat back and thought, "What if I made something to do
this for me?" You'll also notice at the bottom of the main program I have a docstring that talks about bugs, issues, and goals I'd
like the program to achieve but all of this is subject to change.

Thanks for reading this!
